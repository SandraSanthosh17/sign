# Project Title
SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION USINF PYTHON AND OPENCV  
There have been several advancements in technology and a lot of research has been done to help the people who are deaf and dumb. Aiding the cause, Deep learning, and computer vision can be used too to make an impact on this cause.
                                                               This can be very helpful for the deaf and dumb people in communicating with others as knowing sign language is not something that is common to all, moreover, this can be extended to creating automatic editors, where the person can easily write by just their hand gestures.
# Project Overview
In this sign language recognition project, we create a sign detector, which detects numbers from 1 to 10 that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the alphabets.We have developed this project using OpenCV and Keras modules of python.###
# Prerequisites
The prerequisites software & libraries for the sign language project are:

-Python (3.7.4)
-IDE (Jupyter)
-Numpy (version 1.16.5)
-cv2 (openCV) (version 3.4.2)
-Keras (version 2.3.1)
-Tensorflow (as keras uses tensorflow in backend and for image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0)
# Download Sign Language Project Code
Download the source code of sign language machine learning project: Sign Language Recognition Project
# Steps to develop sign language recognition project
This is divided into 3 parts:

1.Creating the dataset
2.Training a CNN on the captured dataset
3.Predicting the data
All of which are created as three separate .py files.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106008408/178007389-0a517bc6-fb1b-4db7-bee7-611a9bf49126.png)


# Summary
We have successfully developed sign language detection project. This is an interesting machine learning python project to gain expertise. This can be further extended for detecting the English alphabets.
